# WebAssembly Particle Simulator

This is a n-body particle simulator that has a backend which was written in C++ and compiled using [emcc](https://emscripten.org/docs/tools_reference/emcc.html) to WebAssembly. It is considerably faster (and also has much better source code) than its [predecessor](https://github.com/edjah/Particle-Simulator).
